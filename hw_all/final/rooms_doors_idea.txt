room_dict:
[[xcor ycor] roomID]

room_doors_dict:
[roomID [[xcor ycor] room2]]

belief_rooms:
[roomID [[xcor ycor] room2]]

Idea: 
; get list with all keys from room_dict, aka all patch coordinates
foreach table:keys room_dict
	; if that key has a value with length 2, it is a door
	if length table:get room_dict ? = 2[
		; for room_doors_dict set the value to the room as key, and a list of 
		; xcor ycor room2 as input
		 something with --> table:set room_doors_dict table:get room_dict ?
